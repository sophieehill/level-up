The Levelling Up scheme is targeted at Year 12 students from under-represented backgrounds who are aiming to pursue the study of Maths, Chemistry, or Physics at university. 

Students will be paired with one of the participating institutions and will receive both academic and pastoral support over the course of two years.

There are three components to the programme:

- academic tuition and support
- mentoring to prepare for the transition to university
- guest lectures from world leading academics

The programme is designed to align with the A-level curriculum, with new topics covered in three-week cycles. Students will be expected to commit an average of one and a half hours per week to the programme.

The first iteration of the programme will begin in February 2021.
