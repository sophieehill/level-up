> Thanks to a generous donation from Dr Tony Hill, the IOP is launching an exciting initiative to help widen participation on university physics courses.

> The scheme will provide support to A level students from backgrounds currently under-represented in the physics community, to enable them to apply for, and hopefully be accepted on, undergraduate physics courses.

> Initially working with three universities and their local schools, the pilot will give A level students both academic and pastoral support through a rich programme of regular tutorials and near-peer mentoring sessions.

> Through this engagement, A level students will build strong relationships with their teacher-tutors, university student mentors and with the participating universities more broadly, as well as enhancing their involvement with physics.

> Following the pilot, which will run through the academic years 2020/21 â€“ 2021/22, the scheme will be extended to other universities.

> The aim is that students from a wide range of groups and communities currently under-represented in physics will be supported to pursue physics at university and beyond.
